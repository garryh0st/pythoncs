#4. WAP to input the height and base of a triangle and calculate its area. Area=1/2 X base X height

height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))
base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
area = 1/2 * base * height
print(f"The area of the triangle is {area}.")
# Output: Enter the height of the triangle: 5
# Enter the base of the triangle: 10
# The area of the triangle is 25.0.
