#2. WAP to input radius of a circle and calculate area and circumference.

radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
area = 3.14 * radius**2
circumference = 2 * 3.14 * radius
print(f"The area of the circle is {area} and the circumference is {circumference}.")
# Output: Enter the radius of the circle: 5
# The area of the circle is 78.5 and the circumference is 31.400000000000002.
